description: 'A panorama of views from its many rooms is the prime reason for its relatively high price.If it sells for its street asking price, the famous “Pumpkin House” overlooking the Henry Hudson Parkway will be a record for Washington Heights. The 1925-era townhouse near W. 186th Street – perched atop a steep 210-foot slope leading down to the Hudson River and highway – has been put on the market for the first time in a half-century. Its distinctive arrangement of windows on one side of the 12-room house give the appearance of a face, and thus its popular name. The three-level house, with beaux arts interiors and mahogony-paneled rooms, has been a familiar landmark to generations of motorists on the West Side Highway. A panorama of views from its many rooms is the prime reason for its relatively high price compared to other homes on the market in the hilly neighborhood at the northern tip of Manhattan. Views from the terrace start at Midtown Manhattan’s skyline and go north up the Hudson river to the Tappan Zee Bridge. The house has a 20-foot garden, two-car garage, five bedrooms, a two-level basement and a buildable roof terrace. There’s also some colorful history to the place, which had been one of the homes on the grounds of the former Paterno Castle, a lavish cliffside estate built by one of the four Paterno brothers. The Paternos rose from poverty to become some of the richest developers of the 1920s and 1930s by building some of the first expensive co-ops on Park Avenue and Fifth Avenue. The “Pumpkin House” was erected by one of the younger brothers, Dr. Charles V. Paterno, as a “husband-catching trap” for each of his four daughters, according to the agent for the property, Victor Principe of Douglas Elliman. Ironically, Principe was reared in the house with his seven siblings. Their mother died a year ago, and a decision was made to sell it. “There are mixed emotions involved for me since I grew up there, but I’m trying to treat it like any other property,” said Principe. His father, a liquor distributor, bought the house for his family in 1947 following the death in 1946 of Dr. Paterno. Years prior to Dr. Paterno’s passing, the grounds of the Paterno estate were sold in 1936 to build a rambling, upscale co-op, Castle Village.'
